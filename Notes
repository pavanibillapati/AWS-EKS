Elastic Kubernetes Service

Why we need EKS?
Pre-requisite
  a. Hypervisor
  b. Docker
  c. On-prem kubernetes

Hypervisor - software that creates & runs virtual machines, allows multiple os 
             to share single hardware host 
  Types - Type 1(Bare metal) - hypervisors run directly on host's hardware to control hardware & manage guest OS
          Type 2(hosted) - hypervisors run within conventional os environment, i.e., host OS would be present on top of hardware( only difference between bare-metal)
